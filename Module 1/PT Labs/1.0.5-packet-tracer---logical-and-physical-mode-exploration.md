## Reflection Questions

### 1. What did you do in this lab?
set up  my endpoints with a straight through cable from my endpoint to the router being on the same network of 192.168.20.x.

### 2. What did you learn?
knowing which cables to use to connect the devices up the chain

### 3. What did you struggle with or not fully understand?
a proper layout of the lab wanting to be done, just committed to the most basic version but was unsure what all appliances entailed

### 4. What suggestions do you have to improve this lab experience?
i wouldve preferred to see an example done of the topology and what exactly to look for and do so i knoew what to look for when putting everything together. It is a little foggy how to fully go thru the process so i want a brush up on it for better troubleshooting skills in the future
